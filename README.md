🚀 Project Overview
This project explores and implements advanced mechanisms for recommending and auto-generating strong, user-friendly passwords during web-based user registration processes.

It addresses a common problem: while users often choose weak or reused passwords, many existing generators produce overly complex or non-memorable suggestions. This project aims to strike a balance between security, usability, and accessibility.

🎯 Objectives
✅ Design a user-friendly registration and login interface with modern UI/UX practices.

✅ Implement password validation patterns based on current security standards.

✅ Create a password suggestion system that recommends secure yet memorable passwords.

✅ Integrate a customizable password auto-generator.

✅ Enhance user awareness and understanding of secure password practices.

🧩 Key Features
🔒 Password strength validation (based on length, character diversity, and complexity)

🧠 Smart suggestions for strong passwords that are easier to remember

⚙️ Auto-generation logic using JavaScript with customizable options

🧪 Client-side validation with informative error messages

👁️ Show/hide password toggle for better accessibility

🌐 Fully responsive design for desktop and mobile browsers

📝 Semantic and accessible HTML5 structure

⚙️ Technologies Used
HTML5 & CSS3 – Semantic markup and responsive design

Vanilla JavaScript – Password logic and form validation

Regex – For password pattern enforcement

Aria roles & accessibility tags – For inclusive design

🧠 Password Validation Criteria
Passwords must:

Be at least 8 characters long

Contain at least one uppercase letter

Include at least one lowercase letter

Contain at least one digit

Include one special character (e.g., !@#$%^&*())

🔧 Possible Extensions
This project lays the foundation for future integration with:

✅ Backend validation (Node.js, PHP, Python, etc.)

✅ Database storage with hashing (e.g., bcrypt)

✅ Password breach check via APIs (e.g., HaveIBeenPwned)

✅ Password strength meters using zxcvbn
