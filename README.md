## 📌 Project Summary

This project addresses a critical security issue in modern web environments: how users generate and choose passwords. The work proposes and implements a complete solution that:

- **Recommends strong and memorable passwords**
- **Auto-generates secure passwords on the fly**
- **Validates passwords according to strict security criteria**

> 🧠 **Goal:** Help users create strong passwords without compromising usability or user experience.

---

## ✅ Project Highlights

- 🎯 Designed to **pass real usability tests** and meet accessibility guidelines.
- 🎓 Complies with academic and technical requirements of a Final Year Project (TFG).
- 🧩 Built fully in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — no external libraries.
- 🛡️ Combines **security best practices** (NIST, OWASP) with real-world UX.

## 🔐 Password Policy

Passwords must meet the following rules:

- Minimum **8 characters**
- At least **1 lowercase letter**
- At least **1 uppercase letter**
- At least **1 digit**
- At least **1 special character** (`!@#$%^&*`, etc.)

✅ These rules are enforced through HTML5 patterns and real-time JavaScript validation.

---

## 🧠 Why This Matters

> According to NIST and OWASP, weak or reused passwords are among the top causes of web security breaches.

This project proposes an **educational and technical response** that not only enforces strong passwords, but also teaches users how to create them.
